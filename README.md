# Roommate Organizer
Welcome to the project! 

## Getting Started

1. Install all of the dependencies as listed in the `package.json` file:

   <br>

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

<br>

2.  Install Docker for your local setup. We use Docker to manage your local Supabase database setup: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
    <br>

3.  Rename the `.env.local` file to just `.env`.
    <br>

4.  Start the local Supabase instance. This may take some time and requires you to have Docker installed with enough storage to download all the required Docker images.
    <br>

    ```bash
    npx supabase start
    ```

    <br>

    If it's not the first time you're running the project, you can also directly start the containers from Docker. 

5.  Run the database migrations to set up your database using Prisma. 

    <br>

    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma migrate deploy
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

    <br>

6.  Start the application.

    <br>

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    <br>

There are now multiple services running:

| Service            | URL                                                     | Description                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| App                | http://localhost:3000                                   | Main application.            |
| Database Interface | http://127.0.0.1:54323                                  | Supabase database interface. |
| Database           | postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres | Database URL                 |
| Documentation      | http://localhost:3000/api-doc                           | API Documentation       |

There are three users you can use to log in:

- Admin: admin@example.com |Â test123
- Roommate 1: user_primary@example.com |Â test123
- Roommate 2: user_secondary@example.com |Â test123

## Deployment

There is a staging branch which is the default branch. All PRs will be merged into staging. Ba Thien will deploy to production when we have major updates that have been stable so that we always have a stable prod version that can be used by users. In the real world, we would release versions + features periodically.

We are using Vercel for the deployment.

## Common Issues

- `npx supabase start`
  - If you see any errors container the word `Docker`, make sure you have:
    1. Docker installed
    2. Docker running
    3. Gave enough time for Docker to get started
  - Once you know that Docker is fully ready, retry `npx supabase start`
 
- Supabase not accessible
   - You likely stopped your local supabase setup without using `supabase stop` and `supabase start` still shows it as running.
   - Execute `supabase stop` and then `supabase start` again.
   - Or simply run the database containers from the Docker Desktop UI.
 
- An error occurred while running the seed command. Error: Command failed with exit code 1: node prisma/seed.js
   - The database may already be partially populated with some data and the seed is unable to proceed.
   - Stop the app. Stop the Supabase Docker containers by opening the Docker Desktop, selecting the containers, and clicking on Stop.
   - Execute `npx supabase db reset` to reset the database.
   - Then start the database containers and run the app (You can go to the "How to run the app (if this is not your first time running it locally)" section and start from step 3.


- You need a .env file.
   - Refer to step 2 from the "Getting Started" section.

## Tips

- Use the local database interface to take a look at the database: http://127.0.0.1:54323

## Commands that can be used

- `npx prisma migrate dev --name {NAME}`: Run a migration
- `npx supabase db reset`: Reset the database.
- `npx supabase stop`: Stop the local Supabase setup.

## How to run the app (if this is not your first time running it locally)
This is very similar to the Get Started section but with some clarifications. 

1. Install all of the dependencies as listed in the `package.json` file:

   <br>

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

<br>

2.  Reset the database:
    <br>
    ```bash
    npx supabase db reset
    ```

3. Start the database containers. Open Docker Desktop. Step 2 would've already started a few of them. Select all supabase containers and start them. 
    <br>


4.  Run the database migrations to setup your database using Prisma.

    <br>

    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma migrate deploy
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

    <br>

6.  Start the application.

    <br>

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    <br>

There are now multiple services running:

| Service            | URL                                                     | Description                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| App                | http://localhost:3000                                   | Main application.            |
| Database Interface | http://127.0.0.1:54323                                  | Supabase database interface. |
| Database           | postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres | Database URL                 |

## How to do a database migration

### Important notes
- Migrations in the local Prisma folder are the source of truth
- Running migrate dev creates a new migration and applies it to the db
- Running migrate deploy only deploys the migration (this is what we do when we merge into prod)
- When these are out of sync we have a problem ðŸ˜„ then we just have to reset the db and apply all the migrations from the folder with deploy again. This means that all data in the database will be lost! 


### Database migration steps
Before doing any coding, it's good to discuss with the team before you make database changes so that you're sure they make sense and the team has an aligned vision. 

1. Run the app locally.
2. Open the local database interface at http://127.0.0.1:54323.
3. Do the changes you need to do in the database.
4. Once you're done, pull the schema (update the local Prisma schema file).
   ```bash
   npx prisma db pull --schema [PATH TO YOUR /prisma/schema.prisma file] 
   ```
   
5. Create a new migration
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name [A NAME OF THE NEW MIGRATION] 
   ```

6. Test it locally.
   - Run the Prisma generate and migrate commands and run the app locally. 
   - Make sure the changes were not breaking and the database would be migrated successfully.
     
6. Create the PR. Wait for a review. Once the PR is approved, apply the changes to the production database.
    ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
